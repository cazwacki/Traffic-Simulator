This is a traffic simulator that emulates the behavior of traffic across two connected intersections. It is based upon the behaviors and shape of the roads at a pair of intersections that were close to my home. It was created as part of a science fair project and received the Research with Social Impact Award. It has the following features:

- **Signal Times**

You can select how long each signal should last. We used this to help test the different signal combinations.

- **Cars Counter**

The program runs for an allotted time and counts the number of cars that were successfully cleared by the intersections. This was our metric for efficiency while testing.
